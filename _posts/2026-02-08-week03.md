title: Week 3
---

My team is a very friendly bunch. We decided on making a Google Extension but have yet to decide what it should be. Overall, everyone seems very capable. In terms of difficulty, the only setbacks were unfortunately on my part due to an issue I had with the beastify extension tutorial on Firefox. Since a big portion of the time was spent trying to fix it, we had to move on and only got to part 3 of the project. Moving forward, we have all agreed to meet in the coming week in person to work on our project. As of right now, I am still brainstorming on potential extensions that could be made. 

In terms of contributions outside of class, I've started dipping my toes in Wikipedia. Besides looking at suggested articles to revise links, I have tried looking at files pertaining to my culture and native language to see if anything further can be added. I have also gotten in the habit of browsing other open source projects. Some users on the open source subreddit have lists of beginner friendly FOSS to contribute to. (https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners?tab=readme-ov-file) is a list of open source projects in multiple languages that are great for first pull requests.
