Some information about Bella!

### More Information

I've never had someone say "tell me more about yourself" and been able to properly respond with anything ; so I'll start this like an autobiograhy no one asked for. I was born May 24, 2004 around 12:45pm to a Fulani family. I was the first daughter in my family and first granddaughter on my mom's side. I have two older brothers, whose names are slightly too similar. When I was 10 months old, I was sent to live in my home country, Guinea for a few months. Those months quickly turned into years and I was raised in Conakry until I was 4. My favorite memory would be whenever I would eat lunch and sit next to the roaming chickens to share some with them, or the days when we made riz gras in a big pot. My most vivid memory is the day we had a blackout and I ran into a big pot of soup that fell on my knee, leaving a permanent scar. I was sent back to live with my family in Highbridge circa 2008 and have been a New York resident ever since. I had a short lived penchant for tap dancing and sewing fabrics on my dolls. Around that age, I was convinced I would become a writer so I would write short stories everyday on the way to school and give them to my parents when they dropped me off. I used to hide in my parent's closet and read books, for imagination purposes. Bella is a nickname for Aissatoubella, and since no one could pronounce or spell it correctly my nickname growing up was Assi (pronounced Aussie), and occasionally Habichuela. I forced myself to stop liking pink because my mom put too many pink barrettes in my hair when I was younger. I never learned how to swim but I really like the ocean; it's to the point where I sometimes put on underwater ambience sounds in my headphones, Percy Jackson style. My favorite fruit is raspberry. I dont have a favorite dish, but I dislike olives unless they're on pizza. I used to skateboard for a brief amount of time with my best friend. I wanted to double major in CS and Architecture until I realized NYU didn't have an architecture path besides urban planning. I have loads of other interests that I cannot list off the top of my head.
